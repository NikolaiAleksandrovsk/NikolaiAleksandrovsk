I'm a beginner Android developer.
Started coding Android apps since 2-3 years ago and that was when I first gets my hands into Java Programming Language.
I also knows many other programming languages like C/C++, C+, Javascript and a bit of Phyton.
I've done a lots of projects but never actually release it anywhere except amongst friends and families.
Most of the projects has been abandoned, but I keep a few of it and I use those myself.
In the past, I've also tried making some Unity games, but like most beginner devs I gave up.
I thought making games is hard and requires a lot of programming skills and experiences.
So I thought of starting from the bottom, the most basic of all making app which doesn't worries me with something like rendering, shading, et-cetra. 
I will maybe someday, make a real project/prototypes and actually release it. 
For now, I will just developing on my free times, and keep it as just a hobby
